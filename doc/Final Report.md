# Internship Report

This summer, I interned at the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB), a leading research institute at the University of Luxembourg. I joined the Bioinformatics Core group, which supports data integration and analysis across experimental, computational, and clinical research teams.

My supervisor, Dr. Marek Ostaszewski, is a research scientist specializing in the visualization and analysis of complex biological mechanisms, particularly in neurodegeneration and immune pathways. His team develops disease maps—detailed diagrams of molecular mechanisms underlying various diseases—which can be modeled as Boolean networks for computational analysis. Pierre Klemmer, a doctoral researcher, served as my direct supervisor and mentor during the internship.

The LCSB offers a collaborative and innovative work environment. I participated in seminars, workshops, and team meetings, gaining insights from experts and staying current with research advancements. The institute encourages open communication, teamwork, and a healthy work-life balance, offering various activities to foster team spirit. Although I sometimes focused solely on work and missed some activities, my colleagues were always supportive and understanding.

The team was approachable and supportive. For example, Dr. Ostaszewski would review code with me line by line to help debug issues, while Mr. Klemmer carefully checked my documents and provided constructive feedback.

Throughout my internship, Dr. Ostaszewski and the team provided valuable guidance and fostered an open, welcoming atmosphere. I felt comfortable sharing ideas and asking questions, even when uncertain. The diverse and friendly team made my experience at LCSB both enriching and rewarding, allowing me to contribute to impactful research while developing practical skills in bioinformatics.

## Daily Workflow

The internship lasted nine weeks. My daily routine typically involved:
- **Individual work**: I arrived at the office between 8am and 9am, started by checking emails and messages, and then focused on my assigned tasks, which included coding, discussions, or reading relevant literature. I usually left the office between 5pm and 6pm.
- **Breaks**: I took short breaks throughout the day to rest and recharge, including a morning coffee break and a lunch break around noon. Sometimes, when deeply focused, I lost track of time.
- **Discussion**: When I encountered challenges or needed feedback, I discussed them with my supervisor or colleagues, who were always approachable and willing to help.
- **Team meetings**: Our team held regular meetings on Thursdays to discuss progress, share updates, and plan future tasks. I actively participated, contributing ideas and learning from others.
- **Reporting**: LCSB organizes various reports and presentations to share research findings and progress with the broader scientific community. I had the opportunity to learn from others during these sessions.

## Working with Other Team Members

Our work was original; no one had conducted such benchmarking before. Since I lacked a biology background, I had many questions and sometimes misunderstood the project goals, leading to unnecessary work. However, my supervisor and colleagues were patient and understanding, explaining concepts clearly and providing additional resources for me to study.

Occasionally, I encountered counterintuitive results, such as how to perturb networks and evaluate outcomes. Mr. Klemmer (biology background), Mr. Gleb (mathematics and biology background), and I would discuss these issues together. Since I do not have a biology background, it was challenging to translate biological problems into mathematical ones. Thanks to Mr. Gleb's help, we could bridge this gap. We would start by formulating a hypothesis, gradually extending and refining it until it became a feasible method.

We adopted an iterative approach: starting with a simple idea, testing it on a small dataset, and then gradually increasing the complexity and dataset size. I handled the coding, Mr. Klemmer helped me understand the biological aspects, and Dr. Ostaszewski guided the overall project direction. I updated the team when important milestones were reached or new discoveries made. Mr. Klemmer explained the reasoning behind findings and helped analyze results, while Dr. Ostaszewski provided suggestions for next steps.

## Reflection on the Internship Experience

Note at the beginning: my observations are based on limited experience and may not be universally accurate.

There are significant differences between Chinese and European work cultures. Based on my past experience, I found that in China, people often work overtime and face high work intensity. In Europe, there is a greater emphasis on work-life balance, with people finishing work on time and leaving the office. There are generally no strict requirements or KPIs to meet; individuals manage their own time and tasks.

After the pandemic, the economy in China has faced challenges, with many companies downsizing or closing. Job security and future prospects are common concerns. Social pressures, such as age limits for job applicants, buying a house, marriage, and supporting family, add to the stress. As a result, people work hard to prove their value or seek new opportunities, sometimes leading to isolated relationships among colleagues.

In Europe, the situation is somewhat different. People seem less worried about job security and future prospects, at least outwardly. Work and life are approached with a more relaxed attitude, and private matters are rarely discussed at work. Generally, colleagues maintain good relationships, often chatting and having lunch together. While this creates a friendly atmosphere, it can sometimes blur professional boundaries (though not at LCSB).

This relaxed environment allows people to focus on their work without fear of making mistakes. I cannot say which culture is better, but for me, working with anxiety means I may perform differently. Most of the time, I was unaware of my anxiety and let it dominate my actions. I tried to do more and learn more to gain a sense of security. This internship did not relieve my anxiety, but the cultural differences made me more aware of it.

My work was appreciated and recognized. The team valued my efforts and contributions, providing positive feedback and encouragement, even for achievements I considered minor. This was different from my past experiences and prompted me to reconsider the definitions of success and failure. I realized that success is overcoming difficulties and challenges, while failure is giving up. Even small progress is still progress.

## Conclusion

Overall, my internship at LCSB was a highly rewarding experience. I gained valuable skills in bioinformatics, data analysis, and scientific communication. The supportive and collaborative work environment allowed me to thrive and contribute meaningfully to ongoing research projects. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with such a talented team and look forward to applying the knowledge and skills I acquired during this internship in my future endeavors.
