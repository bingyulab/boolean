# Internship Report

This summer, I interned at the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB), a leading research institute at the University of Luxembourg. I joined the Bioinformatics Core group, which supports data integration and analysis across experimental, computational, and clinical research teams.

My supervisor, Dr. Marek Ostaszewski, is a Research scientist specializing in the visualization and analysis of complex biological mechanisms, particularly in neurodegeneration and immune pathways. His team develops disease maps—detailed diagrams of molecular mechanisms underlying various diseases—which can be modeled as boolean networks for computational analysis. Pierre Klemmer, a doctoral researcher, served as my direct supervisor and mentor during the internship.

The LCSB offers a collaborative and innovative work environment. I participated in seminars, workshops, and team meetings, gaining insights from experts and staying current with research advancements. The institute encourages open communication, teamwork, and a healthy work-life balance, offering various activities to foster team spirit. Although I sometimes focused solely on work and missed some activities, my colleagues were always supportive and understanding.

TThey are supportive and approachable. For example: Dr. Ostaszewski will go through the code line by line help me debug. Mr. Klemmer will carefully check my document and give me suggestions.

Throughout my internship, Dr. Ostaszewski and the team provided valuable guidance and fostered an open, welcoming atmosphere. I felt comfortable sharing ideas and asking questions, even when uncertain. The diverse and friendly team made my experience at LCSB both enriching and rewarding, allowing me to contribute to impactful research while developing practical skills in bioinformatics.

## Daily workflow
The total duration of the internship was 9 weeks. My daily workflow typically involved:
- **Individual work**: I will arrive at the office between 8am and 9am, start by checking emails and messages, and then focus on my assigned tasks. This could include coding, discussion, or reading relevant literature.  Leaving the office between 5pm and 6pm.
- **Breaks**: I took short breaks throughout the day to rest and recharge, including a coffee time in the morning and a lunch break around noon. Other time when I focused on work, I ignored the time flowing.
- **Discussion**: Sometimes, when I encountered challenges or needed feedback, I would discuss with my supervisor or colleagues. They were always approachable and willing to help. 
- **Team meetings**: Our team held regular meetings to discuss progress, share updates, and plan future tasks on Thursdays. I actively participated in these meetings, contributing my ideas and learning from others.
- **Reporting**: LCSB organizes various reports and presentations to share research findings and progress with the broader scientific community. I had the opportunity to learn from others during these sessions.

## Working with other teams members

Our work is original; no one has done such benchmarking before. Since I lacked a biology background, I had lots of questions. Sometimes I misunderstood the goal of the project and do some unnecessary work. But my supervisor and colleagues were very patient and understanding. They explained the concepts clearly and provided additional resources for me to study. 

Sometimes I found some counterintuitive results. For example, how to perturb networks and how to evaluate the results. Mr. Klemmer (Biology background), Mr. Gleb (Mathematics and Biology background), and me will discuss together. Since I don't have Biology background, it is difficult for me to transform the biological problems into mathematical problems. But thanks to Mr. Gleb's help, he will help us to understand the biological problems and transform them into mathematical problems. We will start from setting up a hypothesis, extending the hypothesis, make it more and more complex util it becomes a feasible metheods. 

We adopt the iterative approach: start from a simple idea, test on a simple and small dataset, then gradually increase the complexity of the idea and the size of the dataset. I will do the coding part, Mr. Klemmer will help me to understand the biological problems, Dr. Ostaszewski will control the overall direction of the project. I will update the progress when some important milestone is reached or some new discoveries are made. Mr. Klemmer will explain the reason behind the discoveries and help me to analyze the results. Dr. Ostaszewski will provide suggestions on the next step.

## Reflection on the internship experience
There is big difference between Chinese and European work culture. In China, people usually work overtime and have a very high intensity of work. In Europe, people value work-life balance more. They will finish the work on time and leave the office. There is no strict requirement or KPI to meet. People need manage their own time and tasks. I think both cultures have their pros and cons. The Chinese culture can lead to high productivity, but it can also lead to burnout and stress. The European culture can lead to a more relaxed and enjoyable work environment, but it can also lead to lower productivity.

## Conclusion
Overall, my internship at LCSB was a highly rewarding experience. I gained valuable skills in bioinformatics, data analysis, and scientific communication. The supportive and collaborative work environment allowed me to thrive and contribute meaningfully to ongoing research projects. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with such a talented team and look forward to applying the knowledge and skills I acquired during this internship in my future endeavors.
