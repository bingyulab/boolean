# Internship Report

This summer, I interned at the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB), a leading research institute at the University of Luxembourg. I joined the Bioinformatics Core group, which supports data integration and analysis across experimental, computational, and clinical research teams.

My supervisor, Dr. Marek Ostaszewski, is a Research scientist specializing in the visualization and analysis of complex biological mechanisms, particularly in neurodegeneration and immune pathways. His team develops disease maps—detailed diagrams of molecular mechanisms underlying various diseases—which can be modeled as boolean networks for computational analysis. Dr. Pierre Klemmer, a doctoral researcher, served as my direct supervisor and mentor during the internship.

The LCSB offers a collaborative and innovative work environment. I participated in seminars, workshops, and team meetings, gaining insights from experts and staying current with research advancements. The institute encourages open communication, teamwork, and a healthy work-life balance, offering various activities to foster team spirit. Although I sometimes focused solely on work and missed some activities, my colleagues were always supportive and understanding.

Throughout my internship, Dr. Ostaszewski and the team provided valuable guidance and fostered an open, welcoming atmosphere. I felt comfortable sharing ideas and asking questions, even when uncertain. The diverse and friendly team made my experience at LCSB both enriching and rewarding, allowing me to contribute to impactful research while developing practical skills in bioinformatics.
